## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- (Optional) Make for using development scripts

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FACET.git
cd FACET

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install in development mode
pip install -e .[dev,docs]

# 4. Verify installation
facet --help
```

### Development Tools Setup

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks for code quality
pre-commit install

# Run pre-commit on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## üß™ Running Tests

### Run All Tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=facet --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_golden.py

# Run tests in verbose mode
pytest -v
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: `pytest tests/ -k "unit"`
- **Integration Tests**: `pytest tests/ -k "integration"`
- **Golden Tests**: `pytest tests/test_golden.py`
- **Roundtrip Tests**: `pytest tests/test_roundtrip.py`

### Adding New Tests

1. Add test files to the `tests/` directory
2. Follow the naming convention: `test_*.py`
3. Use descriptive test function names
4. Include docstrings explaining what each test validates

## üíÖ Code Style

### Python Code Style

We follow these style guidelines:

```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Descriptive names, clear structure
def parse_facet_document(content: str) -> dict:
    """Parse FACET content into a dictionary structure."""
    # Implementation here
    pass

# ‚ùå Avoid: Abbreviations, unclear names
def pfd(c: str) -> dict:
    # What does this do?
    pass
```

### Key Guidelines

- **PEP 8**: Follow Python's official style guide
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations for function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings**: Write clear, descriptive docstrings for all public functions
- **Descriptive Names**: Use meaningful variable and function names
- **Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent indentation and spacing

### Automated Code Quality

```bash
# Format code with Black
black src/facet/

# Sort imports with isort
isort src/facet/

# Lint with flake8
flake8 src/facet/

# Type check with mypy
mypy src/facet/
```
